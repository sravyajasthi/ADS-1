1.If the output has multiple values/ multiple new line values 
write it as comma space separated.
Ans: 
	1.Search for the next line
	2.take new String and coppy the line till you get \n.
	3. keep the condition for not adding "\n" and add "," instead off.
	4.Display the new String 
2.Use the following Notations for writing Complexity Answers: N, 1, log(N), N^2, N*log(N), 2^N, N^3, log(N)
	1.1st element in stack 0
	2. 2nd element in stack 1
	3.3rd element in stack 0
	4.4th element in stack 0
	5.5th element in stack 1
	6.6th element in stack 1
	complexcity :N*log(N)
3. Give the output printed by Queue for the input at the end of all operations
If “-” perform dequeue else enqueue each word.

4.Suppose that a client performs an intermixed sequence of (stack) push and pop operations. 
The push operations put the integers 0 through 9 in order onto the stack; the pop operations print out the return values. 
Which of the following sequence(s) could not occur?
Note: For answer write the options in order separated with comma and space eg: a, b, d 
a. 5 4 3 1 2 0 9 8 7 6
b. 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
c. 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
d. 1 3 5 7 9 2 4 6 8 0
e. 1 5 0 2 3 4 6 7 8 9
ans:b,c
5. {[]()} If you use stacks for checking parentheses balanced or not ? After each iteration, Print the size of the stack.
ans : yes balanced
	{	
	[
	yes
	]
	2nd
	{
	(
	yes
	)
	3rd
	{
	yes
	}
	4th
	stack empty.
9.Give the order of growth (as a function of n ) of the running times of the following code fragment:		
ans:N^2
8.Ans:N
7.N^2
6.ans:N*log(N)
